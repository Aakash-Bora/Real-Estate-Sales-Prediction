# Real-Estate-Sales-Prediction

# Description:
Welcome to the Real Estate Sales Prediction project! In this repository, we delve into the fascinating world of machine learning to predict real estate sales outcomes with a focus on residential properties in the town of Bristol. Our project harnesses the power of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, a robust machine learning technique, to unlock valuable insights and make informed predictions.


# Project Overview:

Machine Learning:
Machine learning (ML) is the process of building algorithms that can "learn" from data. ML takes a dataset and endeavors to construct a model that can accurately predict future data or fill in missing information. In our case, we aim to predict real estate sales in Bristol based on historical data.

# Project Objectives:
* 		Train a Model: We use the Scikit-learn library to generate and train an SVM model with an 80/20 training/validation split.
* 		Validation: Test the model's performance against a validation dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
* 		Future Predictions: Utilize the trained SVM model to make predictions about future real estate sales.

# Libraries Used:
* NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. In our project, NumPy is used for data manipulation and numerical computations.
* Pandas: Pandas is a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis. We employ Pandas to read, clean, and preprocess the real estate sales dataset. It helps us organize and explore the data effectively.
* Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library that allows us to create various types of plots and charts. In our project, Matplotlib is used to generate informative graphs and visualizations to understand the dataset and model performance better.
* Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a widely-used machine learning library that provides tools for data mining and data analysis. We use Scikit-learn to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, perform data splitting for training and validation, and evaluate model accuracy.

# Data:
We source our data from a real estate sales dataset spanning the years 2001 to 2020. Through statistics and visualizations, we offer a comprehensive description of the dataset to gain insights into the underlying trends and patterns.

# Project Workflow:
* 		Data Preprocessing: We clean the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, selecting specific residential types (Single Family and Condo), eliminating outliers, and handling missing values.
* 		Data Exploration: We provide descriptive statistics and visualize the data to gain a better understanding of its characteristics.
* 		Model Training: We employ the Scikit-learn library to train an SVM model using relevant features from the dataset.
* 		Model Evaluation: We assess the model's accuracy and error rate by comparing its predictions to a validation dataset. We also display the confusion matrix for further evaluation.
* 		Predictions: The trained model is employed to make predictions about real estate sales, enabling us to anticipate future trends in the Bristol housing market.
* 		Visualization: We plot the model's predictions on a graph to visualize its performance, differentiating between Condo and Single Family properties.
Result:
The project offers a powerful tool for predicting real estate sales in Bristol, aiding in decision-making processes for both buyers and sellers. By leveraging SVM models and data analysis, we aim to contribute valuable insights into the dynamic real estate market.
